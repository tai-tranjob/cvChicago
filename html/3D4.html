                  As an international student who spent more than half of her life alone in another country pursuing a better education and a passion, I often forget who I was as a Vietnamese and I didn't appreciate my country enough.

                  After many trials of fitting in new places, I realised the place I once rejected is the place that accepts me. I do have a place to call home which is Vietnam. It’s where I was born, where I lived until 10 before leaving, where so many memories were created that I smile when I think about them, where Phở and Bún Bò Huế are treasures when abroad.
